# Adaptive Pattern Recognition Strategy

## Overview
**Wait a minute, WHO ARE YOU?** is a sophisticated strategy designed for the Prisoner's Dilemma. It dynamically adapts to the opponent's behavior, balancing cooperation and self-defense through advanced pattern recognition.

## Strategy Breakdown

### Initial Approach
- Begins with **cooperation** in the first round.
- Uses a **Tit for Two Tats** approach for the first 20 rounds.
- After 20 rounds, it analyzes the opponent's behavior and switches to a counter-strategy.

### Pattern Detection Mechanisms
The strategy identifies specific opponent behaviors to determine an optimal response:

1. **Grim Trigger Detection**  
   - If the opponent exhibits consistent aggression (permanent defection after any defection from us), the strategy **defects permanently** in response.

2. **Always Cooperate Pattern**  
   - If the opponent always cooperates, the strategy **continues cooperating** to maximize points.

3. **Always Defect Pattern**  
   - If the opponent always defects, the strategy **defects permanently** to prevent exploitation.

4. **Tit for Tat Pattern**  
   - If the opponent plays **Tit for Tat**, the strategy mirrors their last move for strategic reciprocity.

5. **Alternating Pattern**  
   - If the opponent follows a predictable alternating pattern (e.g., cooperate, defect, repeat), the strategy adapts by countering the expected move.

### Decision-Making Process
- The **first 20 rounds** serve as an observation phase.
- If the opponent's **cooperation rate is below 50%**, the strategy **switches to permanent defection**.
- Otherwise, it follows a **modified Tit for Tat** approach, leveraging detected patterns for optimal decision-making.

## Strategy Classification
- **Temperament**: Adaptive and Strategic
- **Initial Disposition**: Cooperative
- **Long-term Behavior**: Defensive with Intelligent Adaptation

## Strengths
- **Flexible**: Adapts to various opponent strategies.
- **Intelligent**: Uses pattern recognition for decision-making.
- **Balanced**: Maintains cooperation when beneficial but defends against exploitative opponents.
- **Resilient**: Quickly identifies and counters aggressive strategies.

## Potential Weaknesses
- **Defensive Bias**: May become overly cautious in some cases.
- **Computational Complexity**: The pattern recognition process adds a slight overhead.

## Ethical Stance
This strategy prioritizes **maximizing points** while maintaining a nuanced approach to cooperation. It avoids blind trust or permanent hostility, ensuring a balanced and fair gameplay dynamic.

## Recommended Tournament Approach
Ideal for **tournaments with diverse opponent strategies**, as its adaptability allows it to thrive in unpredictable environments.
